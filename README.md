# Icon Requests
If you'd like to request icons, please use the in-app icon request feature. I have a [script](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/PythonScripts/tree/master/Appstract/requestanalyzer) that I periodically run on the request email to compile a list of the [most-requested icons](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/Appstract/blob/master/icons/most-requested-icons.txt).

# Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! You do NOT need to know how to code, just how to create .SVGs using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or other software.
Please see the [contribution guide](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/Appstract/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute.
