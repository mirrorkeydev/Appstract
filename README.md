You may (and are encouraged to) continue to open contribution pull requests, but I cannot merge them until the day after my internship ends. My terms of employment prevent me from working on personal projects while employed unless I want to transfer all intellectual property rights to my employer. Rest assured though, that I will review and merge any and all changes at the end of the summer and they will make it into the next release of Appstract. Thank you for your understanding!

# Icon Requests
If you'd like to request icons, please use the in-app icon request feature. I have a [script](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/PythonScripts/tree/master/Appstract/requestanalyzer) that I periodically run on the request email to compile a list of the [most-requested icons](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/Appstract/blob/master/icons/most-requested-icons.txt).

# Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! You do NOT need to know how to code, just how to create .SVGs using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) or other software.
Please see the [contribution guide](https://github.com/mirrorkeydev/Appstract/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute.

# Acknowledgements
